📝 What I Did

Designed an intuitive and professional layout for user interaction.

Built interactive visuals (charts, slicers, tables) to represent multidimensional data.

Applied filters and drill-downs for enhanced exploration.

Ensured responsive and real-time interactivity across visuals.

Followed best practices in visualization (color coding, legibility, grouping, labeling).
